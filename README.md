This is a repository for visualization purposes of percolation, complex physics, phase transisitons, etc..

This will be a continuous work in progress, but the following things are included as of today.
	1. 2D lattice - random and uniform percolation with visualization and sliding bar for $\alpha$, along with a resetting button to the critical value for the system. This has been implemented using networkx, and displays the links.
	2. 2D lattice - only uniform percolation with visualization (imshow) for extremely fast visualization (but without links). Implemented using sparse matrices and sparse graph routines for coloring purposes. As of now, I havent found a good solution for the coloring scheme.
